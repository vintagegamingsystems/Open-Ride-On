# Kids-Ride-on-Car-Soft-Start---Soft-Slow

Kids ride-on eletric cars for children arduino project. Allows the soft start and soft slowdown of IBT_2 H-bridge using Arduino.

Using an Arduino and an IBT-2 H-bridge you can tune the acceleration and deceleraton of your child's ride on car.

I will add further notes, pictures, and further features soon.

This is an improvement over the Patchbots soft-start-code as it allows for slow deceleration of the vehicle instead of abruptly stopping when the accelerator is not being pressed.
