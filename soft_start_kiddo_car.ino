//A video build log for this project can be found here:  youtube.com/PatchBOTS

//I purposely didn't break this out into function based on the response I get from people on YouTube. 
//People looking to do this are usually non-coders who want to upgrade their kid's PowerWheels, so I didn't want to add any complexity where it wasn't necessary.
//I tried to be as verbose as possible with my comments, but feel free to email me with any additional questions. 

//There are a couple hardware changes from the previous version:
// I elimated on of the speed modes.  Previously I had 4 speeds (12v, 16v, 20v, and 24v).  My kids are well beyond 12v, so I just eliminated that and will have 3 speeds starting around 16v. 
// Since we have one less speed, we have an extra pin already wired in, so I'll use that for the gas pedal switch.  Pin 2 is the lowest speed (like before, even though it's faster now), Pin 3 for Speed 2, and Pin 4 for Speed 3, Pin 5 will be for the gas pedal switch.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#define speedOne 2  //defines Pin 2 on the Arduino for Speed1
#define speedTwo 3  //defines Pin 3 on the Arduino for Speed2
#define speedThree 4 //defines Pin 4 on the Arduino for Speed3
#define Switch  5 //defines Pin 5 on the Arduino for the digital switch at the gas pedal
#define enR 7  // This gets wired to R_EN on the BTS7960 motor controller. 
#define enL 6  // This gets wired to L_EN on the BTS7960 motor controller. 
// Changed this so I could input 5volts for gas pedal detection.
#define RPWM 9  // Wire this to RPWM on the BTS7960 motor controller. 
#define LPWM 10 // This isn't used in the code.  It would give us a reverse function via the motor controller, which isn't really useful in this setting. 


//Below are variables we will be using in the code.
